# Node.js Mentorship Program

<p>Being part of the mentor team will be a great achievement, I have a great desire to contribute to the Node ecosystem, and this has long been in line with my professional goals (acquiring learning) and mainly having a very relevant experience in my personal life that is to generate a global impact on technology.

I have a lot of difficulty with spoken English because although I am studying I am still at a very basic level. But I can develop fast with practice.
To read and write the translation tools help me a lot. However with technical English I have no great difficulties.</p>
